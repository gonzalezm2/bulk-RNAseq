This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Set up the folder structure
folder_names <- (
    # Main folders
  c("data", "code", "figures",
    # Sub-folders
    "data/raw", "data/processed"))

for (j in seq_along(folder_names)) {
  dir.create(folder_names[j])
}


# Add files to the folders
file_names <- (
  c(
   # For preparing your data 
    "1_data_preparation",
   # The merging file might also be combined 
   # with the first file
    "2_merging", 
   # For your descriptives
    "3_descriptives",
   # For your analysis
    "4_analysis", 
   # For your visualization
    "5_visualization"
  )
)

for (j in seq_along(file_names)) {
  file.create(paste0("code/", file_names[j], ".Rmd"))
}

# Create a helper function file
file.create("code/helper.R")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
